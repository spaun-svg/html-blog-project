<h2>HTML</h2>
<p>What is HTML?

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a hypertext markup language, the main standard for creating web pages. It is used to describe the structure and content of a page: headings, paragraphs, links, images, tables, forms, and other elements that we see in the browser.
HTML is not a programming language — it does not perform calculations and does not contain logic. Its task is to mark up the content, that is, to explain to the browser exactly what is on the page and how it is structured.
How does HTML work?
An HTML document consists of tags, which are special commands enclosed in angle brackets. For example:
h1> — title
p> — paragraph of text
a> — link
img> — image
Most tags have an opening and closing form:
html
p>this is a paragraph of text/p>
The browser reads the HTML file and displays its contents in a user-friendly way.
The structure of the HTML document
Any standard HTML page has a basic structure:
!DOCTYPE html>` — specifies the document type
html> — the root element of the page
head> — service information (tab name, encoding, connection styles)
body> — everything that is displayed on the page
The role of HTML in web development
HTML works together with other technologies:
CSS is responsible for the appearance (colors, fonts, arrangement of elements)
JavaScript** — adds interactivity and logic
If you think of a website as a house:
HTML is the frame and walls,
CSS is the design and decoration.,
JavaScript — electricity and mechanisms.
Why learn HTML?
HTML is the first step in web development. It is impossible to create a website without it. It
is easy to learn,
understandable to beginners,
is the basis for frontend development,
and is used in all modern web projects.
Conclusion
HTML is the foundation of the Internet. It is thanks to it that browsers understand how to display text, images, and other elements on a page. Once you have mastered HTML, you can start creating your own websites and move on to more sophisticated web development technologies.

  <h3>This is an AD block</h3>
  <p>Experts working in the advertising industry have developed a set of requirements for advertising texts that allow you to create an effective product.
An advertisement must include a title and subheadings. An article like this is much more interesting to read than just a solid set of words. In addition, the most important details should be highlighted in the article. The next requirement is that the text should contain as many specific facts and figures as possible. It is this detail that attracts the special attention of potential buyers. It is important that the numbers are also included in the headline of the article. The text should not be too voluminous. It is best that the article is small, but at the same time as informative as possible and demonstrates the advantage of the product. It is very important to reveal the main sentence of the article in the first paragraph. People should be intrigued after reading it. This will attract even more attention.</p>

<h2>CSS</h2>
<p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a language of hierarchical rules (style sheets) used to represent the appearance of a document written in HTML or XML (including various XML languages such as SVG and XHTML. CSS describes how an element should be displayed on the screen, on paper, in voice, or using other media. CSS is one of the main languages of free web development, which is standardized by the W3C specification. The CSS standard is divided into levels: CSS1 is currently outdated, CSS2.1 is recommended for use, and CSS3, divided into smaller modules, is developing towards standardization.</p>

  <h2>JAVA SCRIPT</h2>
  <p>JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interactive (or JIT-compiled) a programming language for the first grade. It is most widely used as a web page scripting language, but it is also used in other software products, for example, Node.js or Apache servers in CouchDB. JavaScript is a proto-oriented, multi-paradigm, dynamically typed language that supports general-oriented, empirical, and declarative (orienting, functional programming) programming methods. Learn more about JavaScript.
This part of the site is familiar to you from the JavaScript language, and it does not load information related to web pages or the environment in which JavaScript is used. Information about the API related to web pages can be found in the sections dedicated to the Web API and dom.
The JavaScript language standard is ECMAScript. As of 2012, all modern browsers fully support ECMAScript 5.1. Older versions of browsers support at least ECMAScript 3. On June 17, 2015, the sixth version of the standard was released. This version is officially called ECMAScript 2015, which is most often referred to as ECMAScript 2015 or simply ES2015. Since recently, ECMAScript applications have been running daily. This publication refers to the next draft version, which is ECMAScript 2018.
JavaScript should not be confused with the Java programming language. "Java", "JavaScript" are software trademarks or registration data of Oracle in our country and other countries. However, both languages have different syntax, semantics and application.</p>
