# 📝 MyBlog – HTML & CSS Practice Project

A personal frontend learning project focused on building a semantic HTML structure and progressively improving styling with CSS.

---

## 📖 About The Project

**MyBlog** is a simple blog-style webpage created to practice:

- Semantic HTML5 structure  
- Anchor navigation with smooth scrolling  
- Basic accessibility improvements  
- CSS styling fundamentals  
- Layout spacing and typography  

This project is part of my daily GitHub practice and frontend development roadmap.

## 🏗 Project Structure

The page includes:

- `header` – blog title and navigation  
- `nav` – anchor-based navigation  
- `main` – main content area  
- `section` – topic sections (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)  
- `article` – content block with `time` and `figure`  
- `aside` – useful external resources  
- `form` – contact form with validation  
- `footer` – author contact information  

Accessibility improvements:
- `aria-label` added to navigation and aside
- Semantic elements used instead of generic containers
